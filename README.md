Goal:
	Smart homes are essential conveniences for consumers who want to make their lives just a little bit easier. At the forefront of these advancing technologies are smart assistants. This project aims to advance smart assistant functionality in noisy environments, such as a kitchen, and be able to help further ease a consumer’s life by identifying/classifying differing sounds while managing useful events for each noise identified.

Initial Aims:
Identify if an appliance is on or off.
Classify the appliances being used.
Identify how long an appliance is on for.
Create an event or sequence of events based on appliances being used.
Identify multiple appliances being used at once (noisy environment).
STRETCH GOAL: Use a camera to help identify objects inside of the scene as well. 
STRETCH GOAL: Send appliance ‘stats’ to the user. I.E: Potential Power Draw, Time On, Etc.
